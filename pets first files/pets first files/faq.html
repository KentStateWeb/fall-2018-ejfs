      <h3>How old does my puppy or kitten have to be to have them spayed or neutered?</h3>
      <p>We generally recommend waiting until your animal is 4 months of age to try to avoid any urinary incontinence issues from spaying or neutering them too young.  We also try to spay animals before they have their first heat cycle because doing so greatly reduces their risk of developing mammary tumors.</p>
